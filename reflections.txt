Your response goes here!

I learned how to apply the <div> tag, to make a website to look exactly like the customer wants that it looks.  I learned how to use the <strike> tak in order to mark text.  I applied my knowledge to create hyperlinks, how to create horizontal lines to divide text and how to create footnotes.

It was easy to apply the knowledge to create headers, to create emphasis in an objet and to bold an object.

It was difficult at the beginning, to figure out how to create the footnote.

I faced the problem stage by stage, trying to create on the first stage a draft of the website, and in the last steps, trying to fix the more complicated tasks.
