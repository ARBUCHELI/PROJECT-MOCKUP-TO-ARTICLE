  <p><div align=left><em>***<b>Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!</b>*** In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played</div><div align=left>between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the history of<div align=left> Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</div></em></p>

  <div align=left>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and </div><div align=left>ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision</div><div align=left> come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a</div><div align=left> “computer with a mind of its own” is <strike>going to take over the world</strike> not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</div>
  </p>
  <h2>  The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>
  <p><div align =left>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve</div><div align=left> created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov<sup><a href="fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 
  , the</div><div align=left> event resulted in more than <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/">three billion impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the champions on</div><div align=left>Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</div></p>
  <h2>DeepMind’s AlphaGo</h2> <!--Link to a website-->
  <p>
  	<div align=left>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications</div><div align=left> when it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by</div><div align=left> researchers at DeepMind—a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/">a five-game match</a> against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in</div><div align=left> the world at the ancient game of Go.</div><p>
  	<p>Why is this so significant?</p>
  	<p><div align=left>Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper <a href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf">Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search</a>:</div></p> <!--Link to a website-->
  	<p><em><div align=left>  
  The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space</div><div align=left> and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</div></em></p>
  <p><div align=left>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own, because</div><div align=left> success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition.</div><div align=left> Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.</div></p>
